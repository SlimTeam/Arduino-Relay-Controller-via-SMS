# Arduino-Relay-Controller-via-SMS
Arduino Relay Controller via SMS as a Remote Switch

In this application i have include 2 relays for two different electronic appliances to control via SMS.

Relay 1 can be Switch on by sending SMS with "POWERON1" and Switch off by sending SMS with "POWEROFF1". 
Relay 2 can be Switch on by sending SMS with "POWERON2" and Switch off by sending SMS with "POWEROFF2". 

I have used Arduino nano with SIM900A GSM mdule with this setup and Solid State Relays to controll Electronic Appliance running with 230/250V electricity.

(I actually use this to ON/OFF water motors in a remote location)
